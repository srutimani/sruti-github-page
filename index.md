## My Programming Experience
I took a couple Computer Science classes (AP Computer Science Principles and AP Computer Science Applications) in High School, but I really started programming during my freshman year of college. I interned at *Prosimo*, a cloud security start-up in the Bay Area. I am currently a Undergraduate Student Researcher at the *Healthcare Robotics Lab* at UC San Diego where I work on a project involving robots in Hospitals. This past summer, I completed the Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates Program at my lab. Here is a link to my site for Summer 2024: [DREU Site](https://srutimani.github.io/).



### My Favorite Programming Language
My favorite programming language is **Java** because this was my first programming language and I am very comfortable coding in this language. I like the general syntax and formatting of Java as well. A couple more languages I am proficient in are:

- Python
- C++
- Swift

'''
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
